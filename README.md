# Canine-teeth-of-mammalian-carnivores-The-killer-s-toolkit
To measure canine tooth shape in mammalian carnivores we used 3D geometric morphometrics and tip and edge cross-sectional sharpness. 
In this R-code and accompanying datasets we use phylogenetic comparative methods to look for correlations between aspects of canine tooth shape and diet or killing techniques. 
This dataset consists of an R-project and all accompanying .csv files, surface files, and tree files necessary to run the complete analyses including (partial) figure creation. 
To use:
All files should be downloaded and placed in a single folder. 
Then the Rproj opened, and the Rmd file opened and run. 
All files are required to run the code. 

All data manipulation and analysis was performed using RStudio statistical and graphical environment (R version 4.0.3, RStudio version 1.3.1093).
